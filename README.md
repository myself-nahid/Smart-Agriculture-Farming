# Smart Agriculture Farming

## Project Overview
Smart Agriculture Farming is a web application developed to assist farmers in making informed agricultural decisions using machine learning and deep learning. The project is divided into three key modules:
-	**Crop Recommendation:** Suggests the best crop to grow based on environmental and soil conditions.
-	**Fertilizer Recommendation:** Recommends optimal fertilizer combinations based on crop requirements and soil properties.
-	**Crop Disease Prediction:** Detects and identifies crop diseases from images, helping farmers take timely actions.
  
## Features
-	Crop Recommendation: Uses machine learning to suggest crops suitable for specific conditions.
-	Fertilizer Recommendation: Suggests appropriate fertilizers for optimal crop growth.
-	Crop Disease Prediction: Utilizes deep learning to analyze images of crops and detect diseases, offering quick and reliable diagnoses.
  
## Project Structure
### The project structure includes:
-	Frontend: A user-friendly interface for interacting with the recommendation and prediction modules.
-	Backend: Machine learning and deep learning models for prediction, powered by Python, Flask, and OpenCV.
-	Database: Stores crop, fertilizer, and disease data to support recommendations and predictions.

## How to use üíª
- Crop Recommendation system ==> enter the corresponding nutrient values of your soil, state and city. Note that, the N-P-K (Nitrogen-Phosphorous-Pottasium) values to be entered should be the ratio between them. Refer [this website](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/garden-how-to/soil-fertilizers/fertilizer-numbers-npk.htm) for more information.
Note: When you enter the city name, make sure to enter mostly common city names. Remote cities/towns may not be available in the [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/) from where humidity, temperature data is fetched.

- Fertilizer suggestion system ==> Enter the nutrient contents of your soil and the crop you want to grow. The algorithm will tell which nutrient the soil has excess of or lacks. Accordingly, it will give suggestions for buying fertilizers.

- Disease Detection System ==> Upload an image of leaf of your plant. The algorithm will tell the crop type and whether it is diseased or healthy. If it is diseased, it will tell you the cause of the disease and suggest you how to prevent/cure the disease accordingly.
Note that, for now it only supports following crops

## How to run locally üõ†Ô∏è
- Before the following steps make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/download), [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed on your system

Clone the complete project with `git clone https://github.com/myself-nahid/Smart-Agriculture-Farming.git` or you can just download the code and unzip it
- Once the project is cloned, open anaconda prompt in the directory where the project was cloned and paste the following block
  ```
  conda create -n Smart-Agriculture-Farming  python=3.11.4
  conda activate Smart-Agriculture-Farming
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- And finally run the project with
  ```
  python app.py
  ```
- Open the localhost url provided after running `app.py` and now you can use the project locally in your web browser.
